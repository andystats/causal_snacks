# causal_snacks

First article is on summary of causal methods with example using PS scores, g-computation, targeted maximum likelihood (tmle), and double machine learning (dml). 

## Feedback from JB: 

* The sentence appears twice in a row : These confounding variables can create misleading associations, or biases, making it difficult to infer causal relationships accurately.
* The two paragraphs in the introduction have significant overlap.
* Typo : In our simpolified DAG, we represent this with two nodes: “treatment with Axyza” and “cholesterol,...”
* The first "external control arm" button has no text associated with it.
* In "What is G-computation?", we have a typo : (providing a way to understand the causal effect of treatments)themselves)
* Typo : We have the usually unavalable Y(1) and Y(0) as well as observed Y.
* I think the potential outcomes notation should be clearly defined before being used? Something short and sweet could do the trick!
* Age also? : Wow – dramatic difference in gender and prior-cholesterol
* The "Using Propensity Scores for Weighting" section is a lot of code output with little explanation. Maybe guide the reader's eye a bit more?
* There is nothing in the "Suggested Reading" section.
